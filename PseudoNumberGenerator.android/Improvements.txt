IMPROVEMENTS:

* Validation on the min/max, min <= max

* clicking on a button forces the update on the min/max
	currently changing a number and clicking a button
	subsequently doesn't change the focus. 

* update strings.xml to create strings for the button text instead of
	hard-coding the strings.

* Add a splash screen

* Add context menus to the last number, min/max boxes, and history text box.
